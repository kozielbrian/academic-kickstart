# Biography
Hello! I love solving difficult security problems with cryptography. By day, I deploy secure cryptography in Texas Instrument's IoT devices. By night, I research post-quantum cryptography. Recently, I have been actively investigating applications, security, and implementations of __isogeny-based cryptography__. Please see my publications section and CV for more details. Outside of cryptography, I love running, rock climbing, and immersing myself in new cultures.

I am proud to be part of the [Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation](sike.org) (__SIKE__) submission team. You can follow our proposal's path to standardization in [NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization project](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Round-1-Submissions).
